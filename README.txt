To use BBPD2I (Basic Bitch Payday 2 Installer) right click on the .ps1 file and then select "Run with Powershell".

The script will then request for you to insert the drive name where payday 2 is installed (MAKE SURE NOT TO INCLUDE ":" AFTER THE DRIVE NAME WHEN PROMPTED, PUT ONLY THE LETTER OF THE DRIVE NAME) and proceed to install the following:

• BeardLib
• VanillaHUD Plus
• WD2 Main Menu Music

Ensure that you have SuperBLT already installed on your payday 2 installation, if you do not have SuperBLT installed simply go to:

https://superblt.znix.xyz/

and follow the instructions from there on how to install SuperBLT.
